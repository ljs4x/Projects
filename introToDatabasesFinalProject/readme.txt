This is the Final Project I completed for Introduction to Databases, IT 125.  This class was conducted using MySQL as a DBMS.  Class was taken over Summer quarter of 2016.  Class grade was 

Project spec:
  --Come up with an appropriately sized database that could be used by a fictional business, this draft idea would be signed off on by the instructor prior to starting work on the rest of the project.
  --Create an EER to plan the relational database.
  --Create a SQL script to create the database, tables, keys, relationships, and a few useful views.
  --Give some sample queries at the end of the SQL script demonstrating that the relationships and keys are working correctly.
  
My idea was to create a database that a naturopathic doctors office could use.  Because of the complexity of the healthcare system I might have been better off choosing something a bit simpler.  As I built and refined the EER it seemed like things were getting more and more complicated, so I kind of cut back on it where I could.
